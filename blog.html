        <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
        <img src="https://www.online-tech-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lorem-ipsum.jpeg">
        <p>Lorem Ipsum <a href="https://www.loremipsum.com/">here>></a></p>
        <p class="quote"><b>Lorem Ipsum</b>  is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
        <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
        <p class="quote">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

        <h3>Wrapping Up The Gifts Of The Year</h3>
        <img src="https://upliftconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MostInspiringArticlesFEAT.jpg">
        <p class="quote">As we rapidly approach 2020, many of us are wiping our brows and exclaiming ‘what a year!’. After twelve months of ups and downs, of pauses and acceleration, we are wrapping up the gifts of the year, and wrapping up the end of the decade. 
                  The year has meant something different to each of us, and we have all taken different paths to reach 2020. Yet, here we are together, ready to begin a new decade, the next chapter of our stories. 
                  At UP LIFT we have been so grateful to be given the privilege of travelling through the year with you, whether you have been with us the whole time or are only just now connecting with us. To honour the year past, we have compiled some of our most inspiring moments.
                  We humbly invite you to revisit these inspirations with us, and if you feel called, we would love to know what has touched your heart in 2019. </p> 
        <h3>Greif, Presence and coconut Water</h3>
        <p class="quote">When someone is in the all-consuming grasp of grief, how do we help? What can we say? Many of us flounder when caught in this situation. We desperately want to ease their pain, their burden, but instead find ourselves awkwardly unsure of how to act. This touching true story shows how a simple moment has the power to make all the difference.</p>
        <h3>Coming Out - An Inward Journey</h3>

        <p>Read'Coming Out - An Inward Journey' <a href="https://upliftconnect.com/">here>></a></p>
        <p class="quote">If we do not fit into a set mould society expects us to let the world know, to place a label on our chests. Yet, as is explored in this story, we are all ‘sparks of consciousness’ and so much more than could ever be defined in any label. Here, we delve into an inspiring personal experience of how ‘not’ coming out was the defining moment for one man. </p>
